## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability please email us
at support@diffgram.com specifying the version where the vulenerability
exists, and a complete report on how to replicate the issue and if possible
a way to mitigate it.

We usually update on security vulnerability reports every 7-15 days. If the vulnerability
is accepted we will open a pull request to fix the vulnerability based on the contributors
suggestion and once solved we will add him onto the contributors section of our readme page.
