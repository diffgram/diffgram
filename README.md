# What is Training Data?
Training Data is the art of supervising machines through data. This includes the activities of annotation, which produces structured data; ready to be consumed by a machine learning model. Annotation is required because raw media is considered to be unstructured and not usable without it. That‚Äôs why training data is required for many modern machine learning use cases including computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition.

# What is Diffgram?
Diffgram is multiple training data tools in one single application.
[What is Diffgram](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/what-is-diffgram)

Diffgram is Open Source and optionally Client Installed. **[Quickstart](#Quickstart)**
