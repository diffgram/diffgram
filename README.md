[Training Data Customization](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/customization)

# What is Training Data?
Training Data is the art of supervising machines through data. The day to day work involves people transferring their knowledge to the computer - often through the form of annotation. For example declaring a region of media, such as an image or audio file, to be valid or invalid. These annotations produce structured data - ready to be consumed by Data Science. This is required because raw media is considered to be unstructured - meaning not readable by data science.

# What is Diffgram?

## Built for Extreme Scale
Diffgram has many great features no matter the volume of annotation. 
Diffgram is unique in that we think about scale across all aspects of the system.

Do *any* of these apply to you?
* Models running in staging or production?
* Are using pre-labels or interactive automations?
* Need versioning?
* Have expanding use cases or need better model performance?
* Expanding your annotation team or needs? Have multiple teams accessing training data?
* Using complex data types like video, 3D, multi-modal?

These things all stack to make for 10, 100, 1000x+ increases in volumes of annotation needs.

A *single* Diffgram install is capable of 100,000,000+ (100 Million+) annotations. We plan to scale it to support 10,000,000,000 (10 Billion+) *per install*
in 2022. [More on Scale](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/scale-store-any-scale-of-dataset-and-access-slices-instantly)

Examples of things we think about for you that go beyond the literal numbers:
* Is this cost effective at scale? If you need an automation to produce millions of instances, how can we do that in a way that approaches $0?
* What does access time for data look like when the volume is 10x 100x 1000x+?
* What does the annotator experience look like if the system is at max ingestion capacity?
* How does a new team get data in and out of Diffgram in an easy standard process?
* How can teams access data across Diffgram installations? How can we serve multiple team‚Äôs needs through one unified data model?

If you need extreme scale - choose Diffgram.
