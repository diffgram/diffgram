### Who is Diffgram for?
Data Scientists, Project Admins, Software Engineers, 
Data Annotators and Subject Matter Experts.

### What problem does Diffgram solve?
The current state of multiple tools is a huge pain. 
Integrating these complex toolchains, context switching, human training, 
costs for multiple applications all add up.

### Why Diffgram?
Diffgram solves this by bringing all the functions of a complex 
toolchain directly into one application. Replacing as many as 9 tools 
with one single integrated application.

### What are Diffgramâ€™s competitive advantages?
One single Application with all the features you require.

### What is Diffgram a drop in replacement for?
Diffgram is a drop in replacement for the following systems: 
Labelbox, CVAT, SuperAnnotate, Label Studio (Heartex), 
V7 Labs (Darwin), BasicAI, SuperbAI, Kili-Technology, HastyAI, Dataloop, Keymakr.

Directionally, Diffgram will replace Aquarium Learning, Scale Nucleus, DVC, ActiveLoop and more.

### How much does this cost?
First, the Full Platform is Open Source. There is no trick where it "sort of works"
but you need to pay for a SaaS service to really use it. This is the full core product.

### What limits are there on the free edition?
If you have less then 20 people using it there are few intentional limits you are likely to bump into.

If you have 20+ people using it we encourage you to consider [Enterprise Edition](https://diffgram.com/enterprise).

If you have 30+ people using for an extended period of time without upgrading 
to Enterprise you may hit some limits. 
We reserve the right to publish more assertive limits in future editions to encourage
good enterprise citizens who are happy and using the software to support it via Enterprise.

#  Features
This is an ACTIVE project. We are very open to feedback and encourage you to create [Issues](https://github.com/diffgram/diffgram/issues) and help us grow!

## User Friendly
* NEW Streamlined Annotation UI suitable both from "First Time" Subject Matter Experts, and powerful options for Professional Full Time Annotators

## Ingest
Ingest prediction data without a software engineer.

* [NEW Import Wizard](https://medium.com/diffgram/now-anyone-can-turn-spreadsheets-into-editable-pre-labels-more-saving-hundreds-of-hours-of-bbc756ec7b49) saves you hours having to map your data (pre-labels, QA, debug etc.).
* [All-Cloud Integrated File Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7yiW5wpnMg&t=59s)

## Store
Collaboration across teams between machine learning, product, ops, managers, and more.

* Store virtually [any scale](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/scale-store-any-scale-of-dataset-and-access-slices-instantly) of dataset and instantly access slices of the data to avoid having to download/unzip/load.
* Fast access to datasets from multiple machines. Have multiple Data Scientists working on the same data.
* Integrates with your tools and 3rd party workforces. [Integrations](#integrations)
It's a database for your training data, both metadata and access of raw BLOB data (over top of your storage choice).

## Workflow

## Debug
Use your models to debug the human. Visually see errors.

Diffgram is an amazing way to access, view, compare, and collaborate on datasets to 
create the highest quality models. Because these features are fully integrated with the Annotation Tooling, it's absolutely seamless to go from spotting an issue, to creating a labeling campaign, updating schema, etc  to correct it.
