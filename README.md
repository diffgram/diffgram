# Integrate Human Supervision into your Platform.
Diffgram has a “Platform” level approach meaning that you can integrate Diffgram into your application. We support your team programmatically changing the UI (Schema, layout, etc.) like in Streamlit. This means that you can collect and annotate timely data from users. In other words, we are the platform behind your platform, an integrated part of your application, to ship new & better AI products faster.

* [Annotation](https://diffgram.com/main/product) display ML outputs and annotated data customized to your application needs, collect human feedback and supervision, smoothly integrate with your ML (Machine Learning) programs.
* [Catalog](https://diffgram.com/main/catalog): query and stream annotated data.
* [Workflow](https://diffgram.com/main/workflow-product) unlocks an ecosystem of tools to take your training to the next level.

### New March 2023 
[Conversational & LLM (Preview)](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/conversational-annotation)
Use Diffgram as your UI to display large-language model (LLM) outputs, collect user feedback (such as preferred response, ratings, and more), and display results back to the user. We are actively collecting feedback on this new area please join our slack channel to discuss your needs.

[Grid/Multi Modal](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/multi-modal-annotation)
Annotate multiple files, such as images, simultaneously and independently. Customize your UI look and feel using grid slots, such as defining the front and back of a document, or multiple pages. Plus (upcoming) render multiple media types in the grid view, such as images beside audio.

## License
You can use Diffgram up to the [Commerical Open Source License](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/license) limits or we can dial in a custom solution built on top of Diffgram for your exact needs, that’s our specialty. We have done it so many times we have a standard [3 month pilot process](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/enterprise#pilot).
