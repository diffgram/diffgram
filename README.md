### New
[Conversational & LLM (Preview)](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/conversational-annotation)
Use Diffgram as your UI to display large-language model (LLM) outputs, collect user feedback (such as preferred response, ratings, and more), and display results back to the user. We are actively collecting feedback on this new area please join our slack channel to discuss your needs.

[Grid/Multi Modal](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/multi-modal-annotation)
Annotate multiple files, such as images, simultaneously and independently. Customize your UI look and feel using grid slots, such as defining the front and back of a document, or multiple pages. Plus (upcoming) render multiple media types in the grid view, such as images beside audio.

## License
You can use Diffgram up to the [Commerical Open Source License](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/license) limits or we can dial in a custom solution built on top of Diffgram for your exact needs, that’s our specialty. We have done it so many times we have a standard [3 month pilot process](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/enterprise#pilot).
