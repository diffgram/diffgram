# Open Source Training Data Platform
Diffgram is an open source platform with three major parts: Annotation, Catalog and Workflow

* [Catalog](https://diffgram.com/main/catalog): query and stream datasets.
* [Workflow](https://diffgram.com/main/workflow-product) unlocks an ecosystem of tools to take your training to the next level.

You can use Diffgram to create and maintain ML programs.
