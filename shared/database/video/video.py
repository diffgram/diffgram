        Assumptions:
            BOTH thumbnail and raw file
            use the same url_signed_expiry

            So when we update the urls we also must update
            1) raw file
            2) thumbnail
            3) the url_signed_expiry

            We had an earlier pattern of storing the asset path
            for the file signed url, but the thumbnail follows
            different pattern...

            There is NO preivew_image in the new frame context
            because we don't create Image objects for frames

            TODO would like to refactor this signed url checking
            into it's own function

        Passing project
            A Video is nearly always a child of a File
            So since we store Project on File already
            it seems reasonable to pass it to Video when needed
            (instead of Video storing it).


        Jan 28, 2020
            We are subtracting the "offset" to guarantee
            a minimum number of days since generation.
            in context of export generation.

            Another option of course would be to just generate
            a new URL for the export only
            at a specific number of days...

            As a manual test I looked at some old
            and new expires in exports to see if it returned
            as expected and it did. To mock a test case would
            want an expiry that was clearly old (ie last month)
            and one that's still "valid" but less then the minimum
            days.
            ------------

            TODO review how long / we want to generate
            the new URL for ie

            We could do something like
            new_days = 60
            new_expiry_offset = 86400 * new_days

            BUT we would have to pass this down to get_frame_url() too
            because that has some other generation thing...
            so would need to update a bit more the just what's in this function.


            CAUTION with the <= comparison the time to check should be a
            "+" because we are wanting to make sure that it's still valid going into the
            future that number of days (was in context of export).
            Otherwise this can fail.

            TODO some type of testing, ie that a given video with that time stamp works as expected.

            Already tested and for tasks it is providing this stuff as expected.


            We assume that we want to create the URL for a longer duration
            then what is valid.

            Things I would like to test here
            * It can regenerate as expected
            * It does not regenerate when not needed
            * It regenerates at right time

            One test is to load an old file
            expect it to fire first time, then when reload not fire

            We assume that minimum days should always be lower then
            new_offset_days_valid because
            we don't want to have to keep regenerating if not needed.

            datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1581663035)

            Yes there are a lot of things wrong with this code
            but it does appear to work for now so move on.
            Did a manual test and it reloaded task as expected

            (For example would like this to depend on user account...)
