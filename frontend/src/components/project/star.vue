The component defines a template that displays a star button and a badge that shows the number of stars the project has received. The component accepts two props: `project_string_id` and `star_count`. The `project_string_id` prop is used to identify the project, and the `star_count` prop is used to display the number of stars the project has received.

The component has several data properties, including `star_state` and `loading`. The `star_state` property is used to display the star status of the project, and the `loading` property is used to indicate whether the component is currently loading data.

The component defines a watcher for the `$route` property, which is triggered whenever the route changes. The watcher calls the `star_status` method to update the star status display.

The component defines several methods, including `star_toggle`, `star_status`, and `route_star_list`. The `star_toggle` method is called when the user clicks the star button, and it toggles the star status of the project by making a POST request to the server. The `star_status` method is called when the component is created and when the route changes, and it gets the current star status of the project by making a GET request to the server. The `route_star_list` method is called when the user clicks the badge, and it navigates to the star list page.

The component uses axios to make HTTP requests to the server. It also uses the Vue router to navigate between pages. The component is written in TypeScript and uses the Vue single-file component syntax.
