<ul>
<li> Customer relationship with Company </li> 
<li> Customer logo and similar material </li>
<li> High level statements regarding Customer choosing Company </li>
<li> Allowed quotes from Customer employees regarding Company product </li>
  </ul>

<br/> <br/>

<h3>EXHIBIT A </h3>
Service Level Terms <br/> <br/>
Free accounts are excluded from the service level terms.<br/> <br/>
The Services shall be available 99%, measured monthly, excluding holidays and weekends and scheduled maintenance.   <br/> <br/>
If Customer requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance.  Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Company’s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. 
<br/> <br/>
Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Company's entire liability, in connection with Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than one hour, Company will credit Customer 5% of Service fees for each period of 30 or more consecutive minutes of downtime; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per day.  Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as Customer (with notice to Company) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues until the availability of the Services is restored. 
<br/> <br/>
In order to receive downtime credit, Customer must notify Company in writing within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit.  Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for one (1) week of Service Fees in any one (1) calendar month in any event.  
<br/> <br/>
Company will only apply a credit to the month in which the incident occurred.  Company’s blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of Company to provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.
<br/> <br/>

<h3>Customer Responsibilities & Expectations</h3>
Customer is responsible to:
<ul>
<li>Provide an appropriate technical person for technical items. </li>
<li>Provide appropriate information for debugging, including tracebacks, access to information, etc. and to generally provide timely responses to clarification questions. </li>
<li>Give employees appropriate time to train on system level concepts. </li>
<li>Read help documents - requests covered extensively in help documents will be redirected to help documents. </li>
<li>Proper usage of the system. This is a technically complex system in a novel area and requires users to follow documentation to achieve a reasonable result. </li>
</ul> <br/>
If the customer is unable to meet these responsibilities the usefulness of the service will be affected and the SLA will voided.
<br/> <br/>
        <br/> <br/>


<h3>EXHIBIT B</h3> 
Support Terms<br/> <br/>
Free accounts are excluded from the support terms. <br/> <br/>
Company will provide Technical Support to Customer via both telephone and electronic mail on weekdays during the hours of 10:00 am through 5:00 pm Pacific time, with the exclusion of Federal Holidays (“Support Hours”). 
        <br/> <br/>
Customer may initiate a helpdesk ticket during Support Hours by emailing support@diffgram.com.
        <br/> <br/>
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all Helpdesk tickets within two (2) business days.
        <br/> <br/>
        

  <h3>Support Limits</h3>
  Items <b>excluded</b> from support terms:

        <ul>
<li> New feature requests </li>
<li> Operational items: For example, Routine usage of product (ie for uploading), Provisioning of credentials, Inviting users and user permissions</li>
<li> Execution of administrative items and/or workarounds: For example, Customer would like to do X. Company suggests X requires A and B administrative steps. It is Customer’s responsibility to execute A and B. </li>
<li> Correction of system state / data after resolution of issues: For example, Customer alerts support of bug X that corrupted a data upload. Company fixes bug X. Customer may now re upload data. </li>
          </ul>
Generally speaking Customer is responsible for ongoing usage of the system, and it should be expected there will be some items that require administrative workarounds and correction by the Customer. Additional support and operational support packages are available at extra cost.
