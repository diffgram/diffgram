<h2> Diffgram is everything in-between raw input data and algorithms. </h2>

        <br>
<p>In a world where algorithms are becoming shared knowledge, the training data is the primary differentiation.
    As projects evolve it becomes clear that iterating on data, creating multiple datasets, and refreshing data,
       are all keys to project success.</p>

<h2 class="pa-2 pt-4">Software that brings your people and data together.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Annotate more data, faster and at better quality</li>
<li>Organize your data in more meaningful ways</li>
<li>Deliver amazing machine learning products</li>
<li>Respond quickly to data issues</li>
<li>Automate data tasks</li>
</ul>
       <br>
<p>Bring your annotators (subject matter experts), software and data engineers, product managers, data scientists, project managers, executive leadership together.</p>
<p>Teams big and small are growing their machine learning efforts with Diffgram. Join over 5,000 people, including F100 companies, using Diffgram today!</p>
<h3 class="pa-2 pt-4">TDM platform.</h3>
<p>We believe your team is the right team to upgrade your data and ship your machine learning products. We empower your team to work with your data in a more productive way. Training data is a core competency that top companies will continue to keep a tight control over.</p>
<h3 class="pa-2 pt-4">Modern Training Data created by Teams.</h3>
<p>Diffgram considers your team as a whole. We speak both geek and not geek. Annotators (Subject Matter Experts) likely know their field better than computer code. While your engineering team needs SDK/API style integration to make it work. We understand the needs of these different groups and uniquely speak to those different levels of abstraction. Choose Diffgram for making the whole team happy.</p>
<h3 class="pa-2 pt-4">Powerful and Easy to Use</h3>
<p>Unleash the full power of your annotation and software team. Create Attributes as advanced as you can think of, complex task management, and fully integrated Exams. Yet all wrapped around a user friendly modern interface. Get the best possible results from your Machine Learning and Deep Learning product with Diffgram.</p>
<h3 class="pa-2 pt-4">Focused for Training Data</h3>
<p>With Diffgram you are benefiting from experience. For example, we had an issue with an annotation software system that didn't check if x_max was greater than x_min. This led to hard to debug issues in our model. There are 100s of little landmines we already hit so you don't have to!</p>

<h4 class="pa-2 pt-4">Best Dataset Management.</h4>
<p>Create datasets, update, and continually improve them in Diffgram. This integrated support to continually improve and change your data unlocks the best possible performance.</p>
<h4 class="pa-2 pt-4">Context Specific to Teachable AI (Machine Learning)</h4>
<p>Diffgram is context specific to machine learning and deep learning. For many use cases your in house teams are the best people to do the annotation. Diffgram provides the software for them to make it happen and unlock that value.</p>
<h4 class="pa-2 pt-4">Commitment to Simplicity and Quality.</h4>
<p>For example, in Diffgram you create a Label for a project. Then choose which batches of work use that label, and for each batch, what type of Annotation (Box, Polygon etc.), you don't have to lock it to one upfront.</p>
