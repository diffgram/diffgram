 <h1 class="c7" id="h.owep5jayymw3"><span class="c6">Building vs Buying Training Data Software Considerations</span>
    </h1>

      <br>

    <h2 class="c0" id="h.mwlzk2gu88re"><span class="c3">Subject Matter Experts</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Annotations are a very human endeavor. It&rsquo;s a high touch, high usage system,
            where annotators can be spending many hours per day on the system. This means a system needs to be
            performant to the level of say a word processor.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c0" id="h.xgwoal57eqv9"><span class="c3">Time to Market</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Even if a team and support budget is put together, it will take years to build an
            effective, tested, and scalable system. As with software engineering, the durable version is at least 10x
            longer to create than the prototype. While Diffgram is still new, the product trends towards the durable
            status with over 900,000 files created in over 1,000 company projects. You can be fully integrated with
            Diffgram within 3-6 months vs years to build.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.hszcgwrwngzx"><span class="c3">Total Cost</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">When purchasing a commercial solution the research and development costs are shared
            with other people with similar problems. Diffgram has customers from virtually every industry, providing a
            diverse range of perspectives on ease of use and product quality. The vast majority of functions are shared
            across these industries leading to better value and ROI for you.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.e922wdylvy8a"><span class="c3">Focus</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The scope of training data software is large enough that building instead of buying
            is akin to creating a second product. This may take away focus from your primary goal and add additional
            risk to the project.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c0" id="h.503f9c8w3usz"><span class="c3">Unknown Unknowns</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Creating any type of software always carries risk. Especially so for novel areas like
            machine learning and deep learning. Expect the scope to evolve more rapidly than a traditional
            project.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.bdokrdgmszn0"><span class="c3">Compatibility</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In order to make your system reasonable future proof you will likely want it to be
            compatible with multiple cloud providers and machine learning frameworks. Since there will need to be a team
            working on this product separate from the team shipping the main product there will need to be good
            documentation. In effect, by the time the team building the training data software makes this documentation
            they will have recreated something similar to what is available from Diffgram.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.dyttqse7zy0t"><span class="c3">Rapidly Evolving Area</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">This is a rapidly growing area, with new standards and requirements being developed.
            Diffgram provides an evolving standard to approaching these problems. Diffgram is helping put forward and
            surface the most novel ideas and approaches to improve training data performance. Such as active labeling,
            pre-labeling, auto-grader, and other quality control concepts.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.b5fyvfg7omlc"><span class="c3">Ongoing Maintenance and Support</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Due to the nature of this being both an end user and system facing product there is a
            significant support budget that will be needed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>

    <h2 class="c0" id="h.u64bsdiyzd05"><span class="c3">Open Source Alternative</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The primary alternative is to use or customize an open source alternative. These
            tools are generally either designed for a single user and come with a higher administrative overhead. Even
            to get started requires significant configuration. Ongoing maintenance is required, and feature additions
            are slower.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.1lfc9zwpgf4v"><span class="c3">Passion</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">We are passionate about making AI more accessible and practical. This is not just a
            day job where we come in to meet a singular requirement spec. We care about the overall goals and directions
            that training data can take. We are shipping the best training data software in the world.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c0" id="h.u575lrjy6ej"><span class="c3">Unclear gain</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The primary reasons companies create in house software is to gain a competitive
            advantage, such as shipping a novel product faster than a competitor. Because Diffgram already exists,
            recreating a similar version does not directly yield this advantage.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Diffgram offers the ability to deploy the code on your servers, under your control.
            And to pick and choose what parts of the software to use, for example an advanced user can use the core
            service without using the label editor. Diffgram also offers close partnerships where we can work with you
            to build desired features, or help your technical team build extensions through our SDK. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c0" id="h.i5mu0kpmzp95"><span class="c3">Conclusion - it&rsquo;s a lot of work and risk to build it
            yourself.</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Building training data software at scale is a significant undertaking.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
